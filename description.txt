Title: File Type Analyzer

Description:
The File Type Analyzer is a Python project that utilizes the python-libmagic library to analyze and identify the file types of various files. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can specify one or more files or directories and obtain detailed information about the corresponding file types.

Features:

File Type Detection: The project uses the python-libmagic library, which is a Python binding for the libmagic file identification library, to accurately detect the file types based on file content rather than relying on file extensions.

Multiple File Support: The CLI allows users to specify individual files or entire directories to analyze. It automatically traverses directories recursively and identifies the file types of all the files within them.

Detailed File Information: The project provides comprehensive information about each file, including the detected file type, MIME type, file encoding, and any additional metadata available.

Output Formats: The File Type Analyzer supports different output formats, such as plain text, JSON, or CSV, allowing users to choose their preferred format for further analysis or integration with other tools.
